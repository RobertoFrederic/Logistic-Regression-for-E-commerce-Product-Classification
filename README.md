# Logistic-Regression-for-E-commerce-Product-Classification
****This project focuses on classifying e-commerce products into categories based on their descriptions using Logistic Regression. The dataset contains product labels and descriptions, with missing values in the `text` column filled as 'Unknown'. Text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, removing stop words for efficiency. The model is trained and evaluated on this data, achieving accurate predictions validated through a classification report. The trained model is saved as a `model.pkl` file and used to predict categories for new product descriptions. This project highlights the end-to-end workflow of text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment for practical classification tasks.****
